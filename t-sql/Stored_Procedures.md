Stored procedure encapsulate SQL queries to be executed
without giving total control of the user of the data
As well as control flow, loops and return values

creating procedure

```sql
create proc procedureName as
begin
	<SQL STATEMENT>
end
```

to execure procedure

```sql
exec procedureName
--or
execute procedureName
```

creating procedure with parameter

```sql
create proc NameEmployees(@EmployeeNumber int) as
begin
	if exists (Select * from tblEmployee where EmployeeNumber = @EmployeeNumber)
	begin
		select EmployeeNumber, EmployeeFirstName, EmployeeLastName
		from tblEmployee
		where EmployeeNumber = @EmployeeNumber
	end
end
```

execute with parameters

```sql
execute NameEmployees 223
-- or
exec NameEmployees 323

-- or
exec NameEmployeesâ—Š @employeeNumber = 323

```

Returning Values

```sql
create or alter procedure NameEmployees(@EmployeeNumberFrom int, @EmployeeNumberTo int, @NumberOfRows int OUTPUT) as
begin
	if exists (Select * from tblEmployee where EmployeeNumber between @EmployeeNumberFrom and @EmployeeNumberTo)
	begin
		select EmployeeNumber, EmployeeFirstName, EmployeeLastName
		from tblEmployee
		where EmployeeNumber between @EmployeeNumberFrom and @EmployeeNumberTo
		SET @NumberOfRows = @@ROWCOUNT
		RETURN 0
	end
	ELSE
	BEGIN
	    SET @NumberOfRows = 0
		RETURN 1
	END
end
```

There are 2 ways to return values

Either on the output as a "parameter" with the Keyword OUTPUT
or
On the `RETURN` key word

```sql
go
DECLARE @NumberRows int, @ReturnStatus int
EXEC @ReturnStatus = NameEmployees 4, 5, @NumberRows OUTPUT
select @NumberRows as MyRowCount, @ReturnStatus as Return_Status
GO
DECLARE @NumberRows int, @ReturnStatus int
execute @ReturnStatus = NameEmployees 4, 327, @NumberRows OUTPUT
select @NumberRows as MyRowCount, @ReturnStatus as Return_Status
GO
DECLARE @NumberRows int, @ReturnStatus int
exec @ReturnStatus = NameEmployees @EmployeeNumberFrom = 323, @EmployeeNumberTo = 327, @NumberOfRows = @NumberRows OUTPUT
select @NumberRows as MyRowCount, @ReturnStatus as Return_Status
```
